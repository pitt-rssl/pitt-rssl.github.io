[Spire 2.0](http://www.spire-sys.org) is released! This release includes two
new components: Confidential Spire, and Spire for the Substation. Confidential
Spire, led by Maher Khan, is the open-source release of the hybrid architecture
described in our [DSN 2021
paper](https://sites.pitt.edu/~babay/pubs/dsn21_confidentialBFT.pdf). This
architecture makes it possible to use cloud sites for resilience without
exposing any application data to the cloud provider.
