The [University of Pittsburgh Cyber Energy Center](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/centers/cec/), [funded by the Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/articles/university-based-cybersecurity-centers-receive-15-million-research-and-training) held its industry advisory board kick-off meeting. We are excited to conduct research on the practical integration of intrusion tolerance in energy systems and participate in education efforts as part of the center!
