We are a computer systems research group in the [University of
Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu) [School of Computing and
Information](https://www.sci.pitt.edu), with a focus on dependable
infrastructure. We aim to make the networked systems our society relies on
resilient to failures and attacks, and to develop new network technologies that
help bring people together.

We conduct research on distributed systems and computer networks, aiming to not
only fundamentally advance our understanding of how to design and build robust,
performant systems that can be relied on to meet their requirements (despite
failures and/or attacks), but also develop practical solutions with positive
societal impact.
