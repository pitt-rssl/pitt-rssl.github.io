We are investigating techniques to support emerging internet applications with
demanding combinations of performance, reliability, and/or resilience
requirements. Our current work focuses on scalable support for highly
interactive applications (collaborative VR, immersive multiplayer gaming,
remote manipulation).

This work uses [structured overlay
networks](http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/papers/structured_overlays_icdcs2017_vision.pdf)
that run on top of the internet to implement custom routing and transport
protocols to enable new services that are not well supported on the native
internet.
