We are investigating how to model critical infrastructure resilience to
compound threats involving natural disasters and opportunistic cyberattacks,
and how to design new system architectures to better withstand these threats.

This project is currently funded through the [DoD Strategic Environmental
Research and Development Program (SERDP)](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/).
