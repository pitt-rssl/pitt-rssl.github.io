We are working to develop tools and socio-technical approaches to make environmental monitoring and collective sense-making of environmental data at the community level more accessible and sustainable.

Between July and October 2021, we completed a [pilot
project](https://pittsensing.herokuapp.com/) in the Nine Mile Run Watershed, in
collaboration with [Upstream Pittsburgh](https://upstreampgh.org/).
Participants deployed low cost environmental sensors at their homes and had the
option to participate in a Slack-based discussion group to collectively make
sense of the data. 

Abhishek Viswanathan was recently awarded a [Year of Data and
Society](https://www.yearofdataandsociety.pitt.edu/) grant, together with Amy
Babay and Rosta Farzan, to engage community members in analyzing the data
produced in the pilot project through a series of workshops focused on data
analysis, data visualization, and data storytelling.
