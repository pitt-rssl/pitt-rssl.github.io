### Overview

This project investigates **compound threats**, in which cyberattacks are
targeted to compound the damage inflicted by climatic hazards.

Increasingly frequent and severe natural hazards combined with more
sophisticated malicious cyberattacks pose a serious threat to US critical
infrastructure systems. However, compound threats that involve both natural
hazards and cyberattacks that may exploit hazard conditions to cause further
infrastructure damage or prolong recovery are not yet well understood.

The goals of our project are to develop frameworks to model the effects of
these compound threats, and to design new system architectures that can better
withstand this combination of natural disasters and malicious attacks.

Specifically, we aim to:
- Develop a realistic compound threat scenario relevant to US Indo-Pacific
  Command as a case study.
- Develop a framework to model resilience to compound threats in the context of
  the (generalizable) scenario.
- Develop architectures and recommendations for the design of critical
  infrastructure control systems that can improve resilience to compound
  threats.
- Validate the framework in a testbed environment.
