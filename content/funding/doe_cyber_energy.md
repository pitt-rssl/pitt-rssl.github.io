### Overview

The [University of Pittsburgh Cyber Energy
Center](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/centers/cec/) is dedicated to
developing cybersecurity solutions and addressing the needs of the evolving
cyber-energy workforce.

The RSSLab's
[research](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/centers/cec/research/)
within the center focuses on intrusion detection and tolerance using digital
twins. We aim to develop intrusion-tolerant digital twins of key pieces of
power grid infrastructure and create frameworks to shift control to the digital
twins to enable seamlessly transitioning to more resilient system architectures
without interruptions.
