### Overview

The American Lung Association stated that air quality, in particular that which
contains large amount of particulate matter in urban settings, is a serious
health problem for residents. In addition, for many parts of the US,
government owned and maintained air monitoring equipment and data does not have
the spatial resolution to provide communities, especially those in low income
heavily polluted areas, with air quality data. This Civic Innovation Challenge
(CIVIC) planning process brings together a science team with local community
and civic organizations to co-design a science/research-based, implementable,
scalable, and sustainable solution that addresses air quality, an important
local community resilience problem in one of Pittsburgh's, low income, urban
neighborhoods. 

The project involves installation of low-cost air quality measurement and
monitoring infrastructure to support a network of community scientists with
online accessible tools to collect community air quality data, share individual
and collective narratives about local environmental issues, and support the
community in helping them know how to critically analyze data to build a
science and data-driven advocacy campaign for improved community air quality.
