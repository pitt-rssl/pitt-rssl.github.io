### Overview

This project builds on research that has involved citizen scientists in the
Pittsburgh region in air quality data collection. Through the Year of Data and
Society award, the project team has engaged citizen scientists in data analysis
to foster increased understanding of the air quality data and how it can be
understood to advocate for change. The team hosted a series of data
storytelling workshops in April 2022 to empower members of the community to
find alternative ways to make sense of environmental data using freely
available tools and art-based approaches.
