    <h1>Research</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>Research in the Resilient Systems and Societies Lab (RSSLab) focuses on
distributed systems and computer networks, with an emphasis on making the
networked systems our society relies on resilient to failures and attacks, and
enabling new networked applications.</p>
<p>Some examples of our ongoing projects are below.</p>


    
        <h2>Resilience to compound threats</h2>
        <p><p>The joint threats of increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters due to
climate change and increasingly prevalent and sophisticated cyberattacks pose a
serious threat to national critical infrastructure. We are investigating
compound threats to critical infrastructure systems, where damage due to a
natural disaster is compounded by opportunistic cyberattacks that attempt to
capitalize on that damage to further disrupt the system or delay the recovery
process. The goals of this project are to develop frameworks to model the
effects of these compound threats, and to design new system architectures that
can better withstand this combination of natural disasters and malicious
attacks.</p>
<p>We are especially interested in compound threats to the power grid, and are
exploring techniques to build resilience in the context of the <a href="http://www.spire-sys.org">Spire
Intrusion-Tolerant SCADA System for the Power Grid</a>, which
is developed by the <a href="http://www.rsslab.io">Pitt RSSLab</a> and the <a href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins
University Distributed Systems and Networks (DSN) Lab</a>.</p>
<p>This project is currently funded through the <a href="https://www.serdp-estcp.org/">DoD Strategic Environmental
Research and Development Program (SERDP)</a>, in a
ongoing project &ldquo;Severe Impact Resilience: Framework for Adaptive Compound
Threats&rdquo;.</p>
</p>
    
        <h2>Intrusion tolerance as a service</h2>
        <p><p>Intrusion tolerance, or the ability to operate correctly even
while partially compromised by an attacker, is an increasingly
important concern for high value systems.
However, despite a long line of work on using Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
replication to enable such high value systems to withstand successful
intrusions, such solutions are still challenging to deploy in practice and
require a high level of expertise to manage.</p>
<p>Further complicating deployment, we have shown that tolerating sophisticated
<em>network attacks</em> in addition to intrusions requires that system management and
state be distributed across at least three distinct geographic sites (see
<a href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/papers/scada_DSN_2018.pdf">&ldquo;Network-Attack-Resilient Intrusion-Tolerant SCADA for the Power
Grid&rdquo;</a>).</p>
<p>We are developing new techniques to make intrusion-tolerant systems easier to
deploy by offloading part of the system management to a cloud service provider.
However, this raises significant <em>confidentiality</em> concerns, as sharing
sensitive data and/or proprietary algorithms with a cloud provider may not be
an acceptable trade-off.</p>
<p>Our recent work, <a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~babay/pubs/dsn21_confidentialBFT.pdf">&ldquo;Toward Intrusion Tolerance as a Service: Confidentiality in
Partially Cloud-Based BFT
Systems&rdquo;</a>,
published in <a href="https://dsn2021.ntu.edu.tw/">DSN 2021</a> has shown how we can make
use of cloud sites to host additional system replicas <em>without needing to
expose any unencrypted state</em> to the cloud.</p>
<p>We are continuing to work to develop new architectures to further simplify
system management and meet the needs of a broad range of applications.</p>
</p>
    
        <h2>Community-based environmental monitoring</h2>
        <p><p>We are working to develop tools and socio-technical approaches to make environmental monitoring and collective sense-making of environmental data at the community level more accessible and sustainable.</p>
<p>Between July and October 2021, we completed a <a href="https://pittsensing.herokuapp.com/">pilot
project</a> in the Nine Mile Run Watershed, in
collaboration with <a href="https://upstreampgh.org/">Upstream Pittsburgh</a>.
Participants deployed low cost environmental sensors at their homes and had the
option to participate in a Slack-based discussion group to collectively make
sense of the data.</p>
<p>Abhishek Viswanathan was recently awarded a <a href="https://www.yearofdataandsociety.pitt.edu/">Year of Data and
Society</a> grant, together with Amy
Babay and Rosta Farzan, to engage community members in analyzing the data
produced in the pilot project through a series of workshops focused on data
analysis, data visualization, and data storytelling.</p>
</p>
    
        <h2>Next generation internet services</h2>
        <p><p>We are investigating techniques to support emerging internet applications with
demanding combinations of performance, reliability, and/or resilience
requirements. Our current work focuses on scalable support for highly
interactive applications (collaborative VR, immersive multiplayer gaming,
remote manipulation).</p>
<p>This work uses <a href="http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/papers/structured_overlays_icdcs2017_vision.pdf">structured overlay
networks</a>
that run on top of the internet to implement custom routing and transport
protocols to enable new services that are not well supported on the native
internet.</p>
